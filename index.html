        <p>Technology is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals, especially in a
          reproducible way.[1] The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,[2][3]
          including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology
          plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.
          Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the
          stone tool, used during prehistory, followed by the control of fireâ€”which in turn contributed to the growth
          of
          the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age, according to the cooking hypothesis. The
          invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines.
          More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have
          lowered
          barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.
          While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity, it can also have
          negative
          impacts like pollution and resource depletion, and can cause social harms like technological unemployment
          resulting from automation. As a result, philosophical and political debates about the role and use of
          technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing.The 20th century brought
          a host of innovations. In physics, the discovery of nuclear fission in the Atomic Age led to both nuclear
          weapons and nuclear power. Analog computers were invented and asserted dominance in processing complex data.
          While the invention of vacuum tubes allowed for digital computing with computers like the ENIAC, their sheer
          size precluded widespread use until innovations in quantum physics allowed for the invention of the transistor
          in 1947, which significantly compacted computers and led the digital transition.</p>
